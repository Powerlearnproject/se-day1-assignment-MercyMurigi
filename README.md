Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Sofware engineering applies engineering priciples, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality systems. 
It is important for creating software applications that power various aspects of modern life such as healthcare, communication, commerce and entertainment.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1948: Grace Hopper develops the first compiler, which translates human-readable code into machine code.
1957: FORTRAN, the first high-level programming language, is released.
1960s: The term "software engineering" is coined.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning phase- where you are gathering business requirements from your client.This phase is when you evaluate the feasibility of creating the product, revenue potential, the cost of production, the needs of the end-users, etc. 
Designing phase-  the design phase will include the development of a prototype model.
Development stage- development phase is where the development team members divide the project into software modules and turn the software requirement into code that makes the product. 
Testing phase-  quality assurance team perform validation testing to make sure it is functioning properly and does what it’s meant to do. The testing process can also help hash out any major user experience issues and security issues.
Deployment phase- your final product is delivered to your intended user. You can automate this process and schedule your deployment depending on the type. 
Maintenance phase- In the maintenance stage, users may find bugs and errors that were missed in the earlier testing phase. These bugs need to be fixed for better user experience and retention.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Agile model arranges the SDLC phases into several development cycles, with the team delivering small, incremental software changes in each cycle. It's best for software development projects that require flexibility and the ability to adapt to change over time while waterfall model  arranges all the phases sequentially, with each new phase depending on the outcome of the previous one. It's best for small, well-defined projects.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer is reponsible for writing the code and developing the entire software product. 
Quality assurance engineer design test plans, scenarios, scripts, or procedures.
Project manager  organize software projects and can assign tasks to software engineering teams according to the specifications of a task


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Version control - By providing a centralized repository, these systems enable better code management, collaboration, and accountability. Eg SVN and Git 
Integrated development Enviroment- helps programmers develop software code efficiently. It increases developer productivity by combining capabilities such as software editing, building, testing, and packaging in an easy-to-use application. Eg. VSCode 


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Rapid Advancement of Technology,Time Constraints, Limited Infrastructure, Changing Requirements, Software Testing Conflicts


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit tests are very low level and close to the source of an application. They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software.
Integration tests verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together.
Functional tests focus on the business requirements of an application. They only verify the output of an action and do not check the intermediate states of the system when performing that action.
Acceptance tests are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors. 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining prompts—questions or instructions—to elicit specific responses from AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
 Vague prompt- search for me pictures of an african girl
 Improved- Search for me high quality pictures of an African girl standing behind a tree.
